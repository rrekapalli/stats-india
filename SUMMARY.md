# Stats India - Project Summary

## Overview
Stats India is a comprehensive platform for exploring statistical data about India, built with Spring Boot and Angular. The application provides a user-friendly interface for viewing, filtering, and managing statistical data across various categories such as population, economy, education, health, and agriculture.

## What's Been Accomplished

### Backend (Spring Boot)
- Created a Java 21 Spring Boot application with RESTful API endpoints
- Implemented JPA entities and repositories for data persistence
- Set up H2 in-memory database for development
- Created service layer for business logic
- Implemented controllers for handling HTTP requests
- Added sample data loader for demonstration purposes

### Frontend (Angular)
- Created an Angular 20 application with TypeScript
- Implemented responsive UI with Bootstrap 5
- Created components for header, footer, home page, and statistics list
- Set up routing for navigation between pages
- Implemented service for API communication
- Added data models for type safety

### Integration & Build
- Integrated the Spring Boot backend with the Angular frontend
- Created build scripts for easy setup and running
- Added comprehensive documentation in README.md

## Running the Application

### Prerequisites
- Java 21 JDK
- Node.js and npm
- Maven

### Quick Start
1. Clone the repository
2. Make the scripts executable: `chmod +x build-and-run.sh run-frontend.sh`
3. Run the backend: `./build-and-run.sh` (in one terminal)
4. Run the frontend: `./run-frontend.sh` (in another terminal)
5. Access the application at http://localhost:4200

## Next Steps
The application is now ready for basic use. Future enhancements could include:

1. User authentication and authorization
2. Data visualization with charts and graphs
3. Export functionality for statistics data
4. More advanced filtering and search capabilities
5. Deployment configuration for production environments
